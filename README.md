In a world where the global population continues to grow, agriculture plays a pivotal role in ensuring there's enough food on the table for everyone. However, the pressure on our agricultural systems is mounting as we strive to produce more food while also safeguarding the environment. That's where the sustainable use of fertilizers comes into play, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

The excessive use of fertilizers, while increasing productivity, has led to concerns about soil degradation, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions.
